CLI for Springer.
get_test_data.py must be run first to fetch and store files locally. These files are then randomly modified, so we can check for new releases.
cambridge_cli.py can be used to fetch new releases for the subject specified by the user.

Future versions of the code will be higher-level (where the user can specify the publisher in the CLI), and also be able to fetch releases for all subjects.
